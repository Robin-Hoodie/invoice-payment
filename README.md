# io.oreon.invoice-payment

![CI](https://github.com/Robin-Hoodie/invoice-payment/actions/workflows/code-quality.yml/badge.svg)

Small web application in which we display generated (SegWit) addresses that can be used to complete payment for a particular invoice.

These addresses are to be derived from a supplied xpub or zpub key. In the future I plan to also support extended keys that can generate Taproot addresses.

Some code in this repository might not be used eventually, as I also see this as a pet project that'll teach me more about the technicals behind Bitcoin.
